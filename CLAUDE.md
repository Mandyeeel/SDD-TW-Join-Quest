# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is for completing the joining task for **SDD.TW (臺灣規格驅動開發研究組織)**, a technical research community initiated by Waterball Software Academy. The organization focuses on researching and practicing AI × SDD/BDD development methodologies.

## Development Philosophy

This repository is part of a research organization that believes AI × SDD/BDD methodology can enable AI to produce 80-90% reliable and correct code in the background. The organization focuses on three research tracks:

1. **Backend Full Automation** — Feature files (BDD) → API Spec/ERD → Code
2. **Frontend Full Automation** — Wireframes → User-flow (BDD) → Code
3. **Intelligent Feedback (Full-stack)** — Frontend-backend integration with automated acceptance testing

## Expected Development Approach

When implementing features in this repository:
- Prioritize specification-driven development (SDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD)
- Write specifications/feature files before implementation when appropriate
- Focus on creating verifiable, testable implementations
- Document research findings and development process in the GitHub repository for traceability
